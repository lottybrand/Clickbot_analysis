For such a killer virus going around there has been far too much normality and the vaccine rules and protocol continually change so why should people trust it. 

If it‰Ûªs a killer virus and everyone has to be vaccinated then why are people allowed to fly in and out of the country since we first knew about it. We don‰Ûªt even know if the vaccine stops you being a virus carrier, it‰Ûªs clearly an untested vaccine.

Which is it? This is what is called misleading and misinformation. Asking which question are you most interested in is very limited and condescending. Its implying people are refusing vaccine for only ONE main reason which is simply not true. There are a number of reasons why one wouldnt take the vaccine...what about background, religious? In other treatments other than vaccine the article only mentioned social distancing etc? Am I, the participant, more informed than these articles when i say there are medically proven TREATMENTS for Covid 19 being actively used in hospitals? Hydroclo is not the only one but in the article it says has no effect on people with the moderate symptoms...so what of those who have severe symptoms? The article left the reader hanging.  If people want to seriously find out why covid 19 vaccine is not being taken up by some, then a much more seriously thought of study should be done taking such people seriously and not as kids. This seems as rushed as the vaccines themselves.  I would recommend this study to others only to emphasis the reasons why theres confusion on the topic. ","choice","0","1"

Even doing something as simple as reading the study and results data properly - analysing, not believing without applying critical thinking - and the PILs is illuminating.
Also, please look at the newer figures coming through, which alarmingly show Covid deaths are now happening within weeks of vaccination. In Iowa, for example, 100% of their recent Covid deaths had had their jabs around 2 weeks prior. 

There are many examples of such incidents. I can safely predict that all the ongoing and forthcominb Covid deaths will be attributed to another new variant (all coronaviruses continuously mutate) rather than to the immune-response damage caused by these ‰ÛÏvaccines‰Û. 

Look at the study referred to by Kennedy, in which the animal subjects appeared to respond well to their vaccine, but had an exaggerated response when confronted with the virus in the wild, and died.

I can pretty much guarantee that next autumn and winter will see higher than normal deaths because of this. 

Did you know there are concerns over blood donation where the donor has been vaccinated? Have you actually seen any of the information re: fertility being adversely affected by these jabs? 

Given that a) no-one has so far identified the virus, and b) it‰Ûªs a coronavirus (same family as the common cold, so constantly mutating hence no-one has ever found a cure in the preceding 70 years of research, how can they possibly have created an effective and safe vax in 2020? Answer is, they haven‰Ûªt. The Safety & Efficacy Trials don‰Ûªt finish until Jan 2022 for Pfizer, this Oct for Moderna.

Social media has definitely impacted me in making me anxious/worried about the possible long term side effects as there are a lot of people against this vaccine.
