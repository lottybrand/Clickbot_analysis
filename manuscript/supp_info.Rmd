# Vaccine attitudes by attitude type 

Plots showing the variation in vaccine attitudes in our population that reported being anti or neutral towards covid-19 vaccines. 

Safety: /@ref(fig:figure1)

```{r figure1, fig.cap="Density plot of raw vaccination attitudes when asked 'how strongly do you agree with the following statement: I think Covid-19 vaccines are safe.'" fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../plots/safe_dense.png")
```

Effectiveness: /@ref(fig:figure2)

```{r figure2, fig.cap="Density plot of raw vaccination attitudes when asked 'how strongly do you agree with the following statement: I think Covid-19 vaccines are effective,'" fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../plots/effective_dense.png")
```

Enough time: /@ref(fig:figure3)
```{r figure3, fig.cap="Density plot of raw vaccination attitudes when asked 'how strongly do you agree with the following statement: I think we've had enough time to develop Covid-19 vaccines'", fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../plots/time_dense.png")
```

Trust: /@ref(fig:figure4)
```{r figure4, fig.cap="Density plot of raw vaccination attitudes when asked 'how strongly do you agree with the following statement: I think we can trust those who produce Covid-19 Vaccines'", fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}

```

Important: /@ref(fig:figure5)
```{r figure5, fig.cap="Density plot of raw vaccination attitudes when asked 'how strongly do you agree with the following statement: I think it is important to be vaccinated against Covid-19'", fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}

# Addressing regression to the mean

Plot suggesting that those who previously answered they were "against" Covid-19 vaccines were less likely to change their vaccination intentions and more likely to stay the same, compared to those who answered that they were "neutral" towards Covid-19 vaccines. This is the opposite of what we would expect if we were simply witnessing regression to the mean rather than an effect of the information. /@ref(fig:figure6)

```{r figure6, fig.cap="Plot showing the proportion of responses that either increased, decreased, or stayed the same when asked if they would take an approved Covid-19 vaccination in the future compared to when they were asked at the beginning of the experiment. The plot compares those who answered that they were Against Covid-19 vaccines or Neutral towards Covid-19 vaccines (as opposed to Positive towards Covid-19 vaccines in the Prolific Profiles used for Prescreening)", fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
