We conducted a cross-cultural survey using demographically representative samples from the UK (n = 1533), USA (n = 1550) and Turkey (n = 1567). The most effective incentives in all three countries were vaccination of an expert scientist, followed by vaccination of friends and family members and knowing someone dying from the disease. Vaccination of an expert scientist was significantly more effective at increasing vaccine intention than any other incentive. Vaccine incentives, regardless of the incentive type, were much less effective for those who originally refused the COVID-19 vaccine than for those who were hesitant to receive the vaccine. Although the percentage of vaccine-hesitant participants was highest in Turkey, the mean effectiveness scores of incentives were also the highest in Turkey, suggesting that an informed vaccine promotion strategy can be successful in this country. Our findings have policy applicability and suggest that positive vaccination messages delivered by expert scientists, vaccination of friends and family and risk-based incentives can be effective at increasing vaccine uptake.},

Here, we test whether people are inclined to forgo monetary rewards in order to retain agency when faced with choices that could lead to losses and gains. In a simple choice task, we show that participants choose to pay in order to control their own payoff more than they should if they were to maximize monetary rewards and minimize monetary losses. This tendency cannot be explained by participants’ overconfidence in their own ability, as their perceived ability was elicited and accounted for. Nor can the results be explained by lack of information. Rather, the results seem to reflect an intrinsic value for choice, which emerges in the domain of both gains and of losses. Moreover, our data indicate that participants are aware that they are making suboptimal choices in the normative sense, but do so anyway, presumably for psychological gains.},

As people exchange arguments, everyone’s counterarguments can be addressed, and no time is wasted on counterarguments that no one raises. Unfortunately, its interactive nature makes discussion difficult to scale up. We suggest emulating the most important traits of interactive argumentation in a way that does not require an actual discussion. First, we gather the most common counterarguments for a given issue, together with messages that rebut these counterarguments, and address the responses to the rebuttals. Second, we implement these arguments in a chatbot, allowing participants to select which counterarguments they endorse, and only see the rebuttals to these counterarguments. The effect on attitude change of these manipulations will be compared to the effect of a standard persuasive message, and of a non-persuasive message.ITEMS: Stage 1 Registered Report Protocol, Stage 1 Registered Report Supplementary Information.},

We tested whether messages designed to address these beliefs and concerns might promote intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine.
Method An online survey fielded between March 8-March 23, 2021 with US Veteran (n=688) and non-Veteran (n=387) respondents. In a between-subjects experiment, respondents were randomly assigned to a control group (with no message) or to read one of two intervention messages: 1. a fact-box styled message comparing the risks of getting COVID-19 compared to the vaccine, and 2. a timeline styled message describing the development process of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.
Results Most respondents (60\%) wanted a COVID-19 vaccine. However, 17\% expressed hesitancy and 23\% did not want to get a COVID-19 vaccine.

	abstract = {During the rapid development and rolling out of vaccines against COVID-19, researchers have called for an approach of “radical transparency,” in which vaccine information is transparently disclosed to the public, even if negative information can decrease vaccine uptake. Consistent with theories about the psychology of conspiracy beliefs, these calls predict that a lack of transparency may reduce trust in health authorities and may facilitate the spread of conspiracy theories, which may limit the long-term capabilities of health authorities during and after the pandemic. On the basis of preregistered experiments conducted on large, representative samples of Americans and Danes (N {\textgreater} 13,000), the current study contrasts the effects of vague vaccine communication with transparent communication, which discloses either positive or negative vaccine features. The evidence demonstrates that transparent negative communication may indeed harm vaccine acceptance here and now but that it increases trust in health authorities. Furthermore, the alternative of vague, reassuring communication does not increase vaccine acceptance either and leads to both lower trust and higher endorsement of conspiracy theories.},

While the ability to create and distribute such a vaccine in the short-term remains uncertain, the availability of a vaccine alone will not be sufficient to stop disease spread.  Instead, policymakers will need to overcome the additional hurdle of rapid widespread adoption. In a large-scale nationally representative survey, the current work identifies general risk preferences as a correlate of take-up of an anticipated COVID-19 vaccine. A complementary experiment leverages this insight to create effective messaging encouraging vaccine take-up. Individual differences in risk-preferences moderate responses to messaging that provides context on vaccine efficacy, while messaging that describes benefits of vaccination for herd immunity speeds vaccine take-up irrespective of risk-preferences. Findings suggest that marketers and policy-makers should consider general risk-preferences when targeting vaccine-related communications.},

Residents of two English urban regions rated their trust in six potential sources of information about the risk of contaminated land in their neighborhood (independent scientists; local council property developers; residents' groups; friends and family; local media), and how expert, open, accurate, or biased these sources were and how much they had residents' interests at heart. Overall, scientists were trusted most and developers least, but this was only partly due to their greater perceived expertise. Resident groups and friends/family were also trusted, despite being seen as relatively inexpert, since they scored highly on openness and shared interests, these latter two attributes being more important predictors of trust in individual sources than perceived expertise. We conclude that, where a source is seen as motivated to withhold, distort, or misinterpret information, this will undermine public trust even in apparently knowledgeable sources, hence supporting the view that trust depends on a combination of perceived expertise and perceived motives as complementary processes.},

	url = {https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-790299/v1},
	abstract = {Background COVID-19 misinformation is a danger to public health. A range of formats are used by health campaigns to correct beliefs but data on their effectiveness is limited. We aimed to identify A) whether three commonly used myth-busting formats are effective for COVID-19 myths, immediately and after a delay, and B) which is the most effective.
Methods We tested whether three common correction formats could reduce beliefs in COVID-19 myths: (i) questionanswer, ii) fact-only, (ii) fact-myth. n = 2215 participants (n=1291 after attrition), UK representative of age and gender, were randomly assigned to one of the three formats. n = 11 myths were acquired from factchecker websites and piloted to ensure believability. Participants rated myth belief at baseline, were shown correction images (the intervention), and then rated myth beliefs immediately post-intervention and after a delay of at least 6 days. A partial replication, n = 2084 UK representative, was also completed with immediate myth rating only. Analysis used mixed models with participants and myths as random effects.
Results Myth agreement ratings were significantly lower than baseline for all correction formats, both immediately and after the delay; all β’s {\textgreater} 0.30, p’s {\textless} .001. Thus all formats were effective at lowering beliefs in COVID-19 misinformation. Correction formats only differed where baseline myth agreement was high, with question-answer and fact-myth more effective than fact-only immediately; β=0.040, p=.022 (replication set: β = 0.053, p = .0075) and β = -0.051, p = .0059 (replication set: β=-0.061, p {\textless} .001), respectively. After the delay however, question-answer was more effective than fact-myth, β = 0.040, p =. 031, and fact-only marginally so, β = .025, p = 0.10.
Conclusion Our results imply that COVID-19 myths can be effectively corrected using materials and formats typical of health campaigns. Campaign designers can use our results to choose between correction formats.
