E.g Covid 19 is the deadliest infectious disease that has affected the west for DECADES...in the same breath the article says not a lot of info on Covid 19 as it has ONLY EXISTED SINCE 2020 ? Which is it? This is what is called misleading and misinformation. Asking which question are you most interested in is very limited and condescending. Its implying people are refusing vaccine for only ONE main reason which is simply not true. There are a number of reasons why one wouldnt take the vaccine...what about background, religious? In other treatments other than vaccine the article only mentioned social distancing etc? Am I, the participant, more informed than these articles when i say there are medically proven TREATMENTS for Covid 19 being actively used in hospitals? Hydroclo is not the only one but in the article it says has no effect on people with the moderate symptoms...so what of those who have severe symptoms? The article left the reader hanging.  If people want to seriously find out why covid 19 vaccine is not being taken up by some, then a much more seriously thought of study should be done taking such people seriously and not as kids.

Also, please look at the newer figures coming through, which alarmingly show Covid deaths are now happening within weeks of vaccination. In Iowa, for example, 100% of their recent Covid deaths had had their jabs around 2 weeks prior. 

There are many examples of such incidents. I can safely predict that all the ongoing and forthcominb Covid deaths will be attributed to another new variant (all coronaviruses continuously mutate) rather than to the immune-response damage caused by these Š—“vaccinesŠ—. 

Look at the study referred to by Kennedy, in which the animal subjects appeared to respond well to their vaccine, but had an exaggerated response when confronted with the virus in the wild, and died.

I can pretty much guarantee that next autumn and winter will see higher than normal deaths because of this. 

Did you know there are concerns over blood donation where the donor has been vaccinated? Have you actually seen any of the information re: fertility being adversely affected by these jabs? 

Given that a) no-one has so far identified the virus, and b) itŠ—Ès a coronavirus (same family as the common cold, so constantly mutating hence no-one has ever found a cure in the preceding 70 years of research, how can they possibly have created an effective and safe vax in 2020? Answer is, they havenŠ—Èt. The Safety & Efficacy Trials donŠ—Èt finish until Jan 2022 for Pfizer, this Oct for Moderna. So, not to put too fine a point on it, anyone who has these jabs is participating in the trials without realising it.

Also its all in such a rushed way that you are left with little to no choice. The government keep changing its way on how vaccines are administered, giving longer dates between doses for example and non of this was how it was carried out during the testing phase. Also those that have been given The Oxford vaccine as first dose are being given no other choice and being given it again as the second despite it now not being given to the 40s and under due to clotting. Where does this leave the oxford vaccinated people when it comes to a booster jab as currently there is nothing in place? Also recent statistics show the oxford is much lower efficacy than first stated. Its not made clear how ill it can make you and my side effects were very strong on first dose. I was really ill. I wasn't prepared for these syptoms and they definately were not as described on the day of vaccine.
