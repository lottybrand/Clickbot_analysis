"no, thanks",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
It was very interesting and informative. It was great to see some facts the media not spreading.,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
good survey. interesting and important topic,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"When I answered for people wanting the vaccine, I actually put things that people have said to me.  I follow the information on gov.uk, statistics and studies and I form my own opinion.  I do not want the vaccine as I have undiagnosed issues and don't know whether it would be safe to have.  ",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"I am not an anti Vader by any means, I‰Ûªm just apprehensive about this one as it is so fresh to the market so long term after effects haven‰Ûªt been taken into account. I have had Covid although I took all PPE precautions possible and took them seriously too. The new strains which are developing overseas which the current vaccines do not protect against are giving me little faith in the vaccines that are offered also.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"People perspective on this vaccine should depend entirely on their age and vulnerability. A healthy, active 32 year old is at incredibly low risk from COVID-19. I would agree much less of a risk than a drug still in trials being sold by corporates driven by profit (it is in there benefit for me to take the vaccine even if i do not need it)",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"""Scientific consensus"" is not to be trusted when so many are reliant on funding from pharmaceutical companies. They have much to lose if they do not follow the narrative.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"why are you calling it a vaccine, its a form of gene therapy id say, in years to come or even months, how do you think vaccinated peoples health will be, auto immune disease will be through the roof. You have no data on these human trials",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"From an individual perspective, I have no issues surrounding vaccinations. With an extensive travel history I have received more vaccinations than the average individual, however my concern regarding the Covid vaccination lies in just how much of a threat is Covid to the general population? I do not trust the Media narrative or figures hence it is a person's free will choice whether they should accept this vaccine or not. Much more research needs to be done into just how dangerous Covid 19 actually is.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"Good, interesting study. Thanks!",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)

"I would direct the writers of this study to Mateja Cernic's excellent book ""Ideological Constructs of Vaccination""",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
The first question you ask is quite open ended. Instead it should be stated in a time frame sense as I would be open to getting a vaccine maybe in the future once more research has been done.,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
I understand that people who refuse the vaccine are called conspiracy theorists but I am just wary of it. I have had COVID 19 and was in hospital for 48 hours. I know people who have died from it but I am still worried that the vaccine is being pushed on children and younger people when the survival rate is so high. I will not be allowing my children to have the vaccine. The issue is that the people who are promoting that people have the vaccine have all spoken about population control. ,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
intresting survey,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"I think this was a very interesting study... but I also found the language used interesting...there was a section where it referenced ""adverse events"" as opposed to saying ""adverse effects"". There was a clear leaning in favor of vaccine. ",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
This study feels like propaganda being fed to us to convince the last stragglers who don't want the vaccine. The information provided is one sided and doesn't discuss the adverse side effects and the difference between what age and gender you are. ,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)

"My mother and sister are very anti-vax, they talk to me about it against my will I just want to get on with my life. ",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"My feedback is that the ""study"" appears to be nothing more than yet another piece of propaganda, I base this on the ""information"" given in response to the ""Questions that interest you."" Nothing will persuade me as I have done other research and it's clear you are toeing the party line.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"Given that I'm incredibly nervous about having the vaccine I thought your arguments were persuasive and clearly put.  However, I am very sensitive and have not reacted well to vaccines in the past which is why I am personally nervous about having the vaccine.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)

"I enjoyed taking part in the survey and I would be happy to participate again in the future. Currently I have not been invited to have my first vaccination but following up on reading new studies, information which I am conscious of false / fake news has made me question the programme, effectiveness and threat.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
Found the study interesting,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"if allergy can be a problem for using the vaccine and there are some people who would benefit from not taking it as a result of that, then what are the substances that would cause the allergic reactions?
That part was very glossed over and gave almost no information",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
I wasn't asked to elaborate my own personal opinion on the subject; only to give 3 reason a person would/wouldn't take a Covid vaccine. They answers I gave are what I hear regularly on both sides and do not give an accurate representation of my true thoughts. ,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)

i will take part in this survey with a great pleasure,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
Thanks! I‰Ûªve had the first jab (peer pressure) and I just don‰Ûªt want the second after such an awful experience.  Stuck between a rock and a hard place being an autoimmunie.  Don‰Ûªt want to feel like that again - was very ill - can‰Ûªt afford to take time off to recoup:(. Interesting times...,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"I would have like to have been able to read more of the topics about fear around vaccines, I could only select exact questions I would like to have been fully informed of all.  I am very nervous to have the vaccine and feel coerced by government and society to have it, this make s me angry, as ultimately I feel I will have to have it to be able to work as a massage therapist so therefore I want to glean as much information about the different vaccines before I consent, if I do at all.  The longer term effects which are still unknown are my main concern, along with they are only licensed right now under an emergency license and I believe it isn‰Ûªt fully so until 2023, so therefore doesn‰Ûªt that still mean it‰Ûªs experimental and that the human race is being used as guinea pigs?  In the Uk 99.6% or more if the population have not died.  I cannot see the reaction to these figures as right, other than for the pharmaceutical companies to either make money if fit Bill Gates to push his de-population agenda as people die of various other causes further down the line due to his vaccines from causes that will not be able to be pinned on the vaccines.  Also if he is so bothered about saving humanity why won‰Ûªt he license his vaccines in 3rd world countries, if it isn‰Ûªt about money etc.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"It seems very much like the real purpose of the study is to brow-beat people who don't agree with the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccine by overwhelming them with stats, figures & information from various sources. ",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"Your blurbs were filled with the same yada yada yada that the government has publicised. The benefits of the vaccine are highest for those who are vulnerable - the elderly, sick and obese - the same groups that are most at risk from covid. The rest of us just want to be left alone.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"I am not anti vaccination.  I have concerns about the unusual precident of stating it is safe for pregnant women and unborn children when there are pretty much NO medications that can be considered safe to take whilst pregnant simply because we do not know if it is harmful due to the ethics of testing pregnant women. My sister is a scientist with a backgroung in genetics and she is supportive of taking the vaccine for the greater good but is also of the opinion that the public is being lied to about the pregnancy safety in order to ensure the vaccine is widely adopted. She has taken both doses herself, but also says she does not want biological children herself, but feels women who want to get pregnant are right in avoiding the vaccine at this stage.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
Nothing to add,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
I enjoyed taking part. Thank you. ,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
Nope ,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"I had one vaccine, felt obligated to do so and everyone I spoke to was having it. I had the Astra Zeneca vaccine, cheap one. Then all the news was on about blood clots and countries blocking the AZ vaccine as it wasn‰Ûªt safe. I then cancelled my 2nd vaccine appointment after that. The vaccine is untested, too many intelligent people are against it, the Government tells lies and too many of them for me to believe a word they say,to the point I will never vote in an election ever again.
 
For such a killer virus going around there has been far too much normality and the vaccine rules and protocol continually change so why should people trust it. 

If it‰Ûªs a killer virus and everyone has to be vaccinated then why are people allowed to fly in and out of the country since we first knew about it. We don‰Ûªt even know if the vaccine stops you being a virus carrier, it‰Ûªs clearly an untested vaccine.

Also since when does the Government care about old people, disabled, sick people but now they are the important ones at the top of the list to be vaccinated.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
great and interesting thanks very informative,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"Many of your articles were very very basic with no evidence and then the study expects to see a change in attitude of the participant after reading them? This is something being put in my body and im going to need an article with much more depth than that. Not only that, the articles contradicted  themselves a number of occasions literally becoming an example of the confusion ordinary people face with information presented by media. E.g Covid 19 is the deadliest infectious disease that has affected the west for DECADES...in the same breath the article says not a lot of info on Covid 19 as it has ONLY EXISTED SINCE 2020 ? Which is it? This is what is called misleading and misinformation. Asking which question are you most interested in is very limited and condescending. Its implying people are refusing vaccine for only ONE main reason which is simply not true. There are a number of reasons why one wouldnt take the vaccine...what about background, religious? In other treatments other than vaccine the article only mentioned social distancing etc? Am I, the participant, more informed than these articles when i say there are medically proven TREATMENTS for Covid 19 being actively used in hospitals? Hydroclo is not the only one but in the article it says has no effect on people with the moderate symptoms...so what of those who have severe symptoms? The article left the reader hanging.  If people want to seriously find out why covid 19 vaccine is not being taken up by some, then a much more seriously thought of study should be done taking such people seriously and not as kids. This seems as rushed as the vaccines themselves.  I would recommend this study to others only to emphasis the reasons why theres confusion on the topic.

"information about vaccines seems v biased towards having it hence the distrust

"Your study suffers a credibility gap - you are plainly not writing neutrally, but writing with the purpose of advocating the covid 19 vaccine. You only criticised arguments against the vaccine. Secondly, you're relying a lot on the trust in institutions that has been shattered for a lot of people. When you make statements like 'Covid-19 is the deadliest disease...' people are aware of the very low death rate and questionable death stats. They think of ebola and realise your use of 'deadliest' is selective.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)

It was difficult to pick which questions were more important to me. I kinda wish I had picked other options. Interesting information but lacking in proof or verification.,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)

I liked the way the study was written and was given a lot of factual information to learn something new from. Thank you.,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"In the first attention check, I was asked to select ""Somewhat disagree"" in which the only applicable answer had a ""typo"". In which, it said ""Somewhat diagree"". Just a heads up!

"its a good study, im just still not sold on the whole thing, its not even about the virus for me anymore, im 32 and have have 4 friends commit suicide over the past year.. and my fast network of facebook friends shows the brutal truth that its not just local to me.. im more affected over the fact i seen people who are meant to be wise fight over toilet paper and get sucked into the bullshit of the media, and still think its a good idea boris runs this horrorshow... and the fact it still persists to this day.. we are right back to 9/11.. right back to taking shoes off in some form or another for the next ten years till kessler syndrome finally gets us. im down for it <3",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"Only time will tell how the history of our country will change and also the long term effects of this vaccination. I think people have been scare mongered into getting this. I don‰Ûªt watch the news anymore, I do not have instagram or Facebook. I do not receive a newspaper either. This has been the best thing. I now make my own decisions. Take away social media, and news. I now feel like my world is getting back to normal. I don‰Ûªt hear or read numbers or spurious information. Look at wildlife, are they scared? No!, do the birds still fly (yes), do they still come and eat the bird food (yes), make nests (yes). Animals are very clever species, probably best to look up once in a while at the bigger world and not listen to mankind!",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"This was really interesting. I love talking about it (without judgement). It‰Ûªs such a relevant and sometimes taboo topic, with social media censoring any negative opinions. I loved this!",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
I believe the whole covid 19 is a scam to  have people vaccinated and the so called virus is being made out to be the 'black death' when you have a survival rate of 99.8% why would you want a unproven vaccine which is a trial.I would rather have covid than the vaccine.,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
Not sure why some of the questions were repeated. ,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"Please don‰Ûªt automatically believe all the pseudo-science that abounds. Even doing something as simple as reading the study and results data properly - analysing, not believing without applying critical thinking - and the PILs is illuminating.
Also, please look at the newer figures coming through, which alarmingly show Covid deaths are now happening within weeks of vaccination. In Iowa, for example, 100% of their recent Covid deaths had had their jabs around 2 weeks prior. 

There are many examples of such incidents. I can safely predict that all the ongoing and forthcominb Covid deaths will be attributed to another new variant (all coronaviruses continuously mutate) rather than to the immune-response damage caused by these ‰ÛÏvaccines‰Û. 

Look at the study referred to by Kennedy, in which the animal subjects appeared to respond well to their vaccine, but had an exaggerated response when confronted with the virus in the wild, and died.

I can pretty much guarantee that next autumn and winter will see higher than normal deaths because of this. 

Did you know there are concerns over blood donation where the donor has been vaccinated? Have you actually seen any of the information re: fertility being adversely affected by these jabs? 

Given that a) no-one has so far identified the virus, and b) it‰Ûªs a coronavirus (same family as the common cold, so constantly mutating hence no-one has ever found a cure in the preceding 70 years of research, how can they possibly have created an effective and safe vax in 2020? Answer is, they haven‰Ûªt. The Safety & Efficacy Trials don‰Ûªt finish until Jan 2022 for Pfizer, this Oct for Moderna. So, not to put too fine a point on it, anyone who has these jabs is participating in the trials without realising it. ",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"This is clearly biased to get people to take the vaccine. It's insulting that you imply that side effects beyond a month don't count. There are people struggling MONTHS later and you're throwing their pain back in their faces. That's shameful! Also, please stop assuming that the world follows the ""gender identity"" system. It's bigotry to assume that all people have an ""identity"". If males can tick the female box on your survey, the gender results aren't accurate.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
very enjoyable thanks for allowing me to take part,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
While I agree we need to fight this virus and studies have shown vaccines are the way to do this. I felt pressured by my work environment (healthcare) to get the first vaccine. I didn't feel I was allowed to wait till I was sure about injecting a new vaccine. I have had the second vaccine now and I strongly believe it has caused my contraceptive pill to fail and I am now pregnant. I am concerned for this pregnancy even more so as I am under 30 and had the astrazeneca vaccine. If I had been given more time (and the vaccine more time) I would be aware of the new ban on this vaccines use for the under 30's.,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
"The information on vaccines hasn't been clear or readily available. Also when your name gets called you literally only have that one chance to accept the appointment. There is no discussion with anyone or someone to talk with if you need further clarification or have concerns. 
Also its all in such a rushed way that you are left with little to no choice. The government keep changing its way on how vaccines are administered, giving longer dates between doses for example and non of this was how it was carried out during the testing phase. Also those that have been given The Oxford vaccine as first dose are being given no other choice and being given it again as the second despite it now not being given to the 40s and under due to clotting. Where does this leave the oxford vaccinated people when it comes to a booster jab as currently there is nothing in place? Also recent statistics show the oxford is much lower efficacy than first stated. Its not made clear how ill it can make you and my side effects were very strong on first dose. I was really ill. I wasn't prepared for these syptoms and they definately were not as described on the day of vaccine. People need to be clearly informed so they can make the right choices or be prepared at the very least. It's difficult to trust anything your being told by government as they themselves keep changing things and not shown to be clear, concise and transparent with decision making during this pandemic.

I believe using experimental 'vaccines' using mRNA gene editing on the whole population is unethical when the survival rate from Covid is 99.9% and the long term effects are not yet known. Vaccine passports are against all Civil Liberties and vaccination should not be either mandatory or coerced. I don't believe most people are giving informed consent.,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)

"The info blurbs really need to include more specific information, trial data etc. It was really tedious to read blanket statements when I would appreciate specific data to draw my own conclusions. The lack of this is part of my problem with covid 19 vaccination. Also the qustion about 'do you have a problem with caccination in general?' I had to say 'yes I do' because I have a problem with the vaccine schedule for babies in the developed world. I support vaccination in general.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)

"This study could not have come at a better time, I have been invited in for my vaccine but have been on the fence as to whether or not to get it. I was concerned about the speed in which the vaccine came about when the virus has continued to mutate & didn't feel that we knew enough about it. Social media has definitely impacted me in making me anxious/worried about the possible long term side effects as there are a lot of people against this vaccine. I am fully vaccinated (childhood vaccines) so I'm not an anti vaxxer but a generally cautious person.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)

I have very mixed views and also am very concerned. My son is 20 and as he has a health condition he was offered the first vaccine quite early. This was the Astro Zenica. Then we here that this should not be used for under 30 then under 40 but that he should not mix vaccines . This has added to serious concerns. So what are we suppose to do.
